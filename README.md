# CD Customer List Cleaner (v1.0.0)

The purpose of this script is to speed up the process of cleaning manual customer data templates.

The script features a range of functions with different functionality that clean each of the template columns.

This package runs with a conda environment to benefit from conda's dependency management functionality.


## 1. Version 1.0.0 üöß

### 1.1. What this version does ‚úÖ

1. Cleans every filed of the customer list data except the Discount related fields. **Please review this beforehand**.

2. Includes address codes validation process checking duplicate rows by store name, customer code, address type, and address code, however, for it to work data needs to be in a decent status, including address types, and either customer codes or store names that are unique for the connection.

2. Returns a **results.xlsx** file with 3 new columns **RESULT, ALERT, ERROR**.

    * **RESULT**: Indicates whether the row is clean, values have been set to default, or denied.
    * **ALERT**: Alerts contain recommendations and require taking note as this may include payment methods defaulted to none since these were not setup or price type defaulted to the first in the designer's order settings.
    * **ERROR**: Fields that need to be fixed compulsory for analysts to process them.

4. These flags will make obvious if values have been removed to default or where the key errors are.


### 1.2. What this version does NOT DO ‚ö†Ô∏è 

1. Clean discount fields.

2. **Bad data must be spot intuitively (unfortunately).**

3. Check intention of bad data (i.e. multiple rows for a same retailer without unique identifier: customer code, store names nor address type, when brand only wanted multiple buyers to be added - this may result as an address code error).

4. Validate additional buyers. Analyst must concatenate them and drop them there. Additional emails will just be added to existing ones.

5. **May fail when no price label provided and there are multiple prices say USD, EUR, JPY without label and the USD, EUR or any of them with label. In this case, go to settings and make sure there is at most 1 label without name.**


##  3. Installation üõ† 

**I am assuming you have Python3 installed, otherwise start there:** https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/


1. Request your credential to access **prod_ro** to management.


2. Make sure you have installed conda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/.


3. Open Anaconda Navigator and open **jupyter-lab > terminal** window. Then, run this command on the command line:
```
# This is to make conda environments work on 'zsh' -> MAC OSX's terminal system.

$ conda update conda
$ conda init zsh
```

4. Create a new conda environment using environment export found in the tool's conda directory:
```
# Navigate to conda directory in the tool's package and create the environment with the .yml file

$ cd ~/desktop/joor-cd-cleaner/conda

$ conda env create -f cdcleaner-conda-env.yml
```

5. Activate conda environment from your **personal terminal** (it will go back to **base** environment every time you reset terminal session). Check it works:

```
$ conda activate cd-cleaner-conda-env
```
  
This step is done everytime so that you can run the script on the tool's environment. By default, terminal starts session on 'base' environment.


6. Make sure pip has installed the tool's python modules:
```
# Include the dot

$ pip install .
```


## 4. Instructions üõÅ

1. Start by checking and fixing Discount fields.


2. Additional buyers should be placed manually as **add_buyer_email1;add_buyer_email2;...**. Also initial additional emails into the additional emails columns. The script will add to additional emails those extra emails in the emails field. No need to touch these,


3. Deposit customer list data into the template found in **files/input** directory. **DO NOT CHANGE ITS NAME NOR COLUMN NAMES**.


3. Open terminal and **activate** environment:
```
$ conda activate cd-cleaner-conda-env
```

4. Navigate to tool directory and run **exe.py**:
```
$ cd ~/desktop/joor-cd-cleaner

$ python3 exe.py
```

5. You will need to enter:

      * **DESIGNER ID**
      * **SSH USERNAME**: This should be the same as on Postico - e.g. tsanmateu.
      * **SSH PASSWORD**: Leave blank.
      * **PROD USERNAME**: You should have this from installation step 1.
      * **PROD PASSWORD**: You should have this on your vault from step 1's request.
  
 
6. Let the script run, if there is no error, once it is finished it will direct you to check the files/output directory where the results file will be placed.


7. For best practices, delete this file or take it out of the output folder to avoid confusing next time you use the tool.Otherwise, make sure you check the last time it was updated in case the tool threw an error and you were collecting an old results file.


8. If you have many additional emails then use emails2query template and script to put them automatically into query format. Copy and paste into query template and drop the push request.

  
9. Slack **Toni Sanmateu** or **Gabrielle Haam** if an error occurs.


## 5. Updating  üì°

1. Download the repository's zip file and remove the old one.

2. Open terminal in the tool's conda environment and run:

```
# Include the dot

$ pip install .
```

3. You should be able to use the script as usual. Check on the **version** section 1 to see what has changed.


**Alternatively**, if you are familiar with version control:

1. Link the tool package to this remote repository and pull the new version.


2. Run:
```
# This installs all the updated internal modules into environment level

$ pip install .
```
